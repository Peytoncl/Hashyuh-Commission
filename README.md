# What the client asked for:
Need an automated command so that everytime a roblox user (account A for example) adds anyone on roblox as a friend (account B [the account I own]) sends a friend request to the person account A added.
Will need to add 2 commands

• A command where I can enter the accounts cookie, so all the friend requests can be sent out everytime the cookie expires, so I can keep updating it on my own.

• A command where I can enter the userID of the account I want to send out the friend requests to.
